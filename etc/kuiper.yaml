# The default options for all rules. Each rule can override this setting by defining its own option
rule:

sink:
  # The cache persistence threshold size. If the message in sink cache is larger than 10, then it triggers persistence. If you find
  # the remote system is slow to response, or sink throughput is small, then it's recommend to increase below 2 configurations.

  # The message persistence is triggered by a ticker, and cacheTriggerCount is for using configure the count to trigger the persistence procedure
