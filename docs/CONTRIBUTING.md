# How to contribute

We're really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to help this project come to fruition.

## Did you find a bug?

- **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/lf-edge/ekuiper/issues).
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/lf-edge/ekuiper/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

## Code and doc contribution

Welcome to contribute code to provide features or fix bugs. 

### One time setup

We use GitHub pull request to review proposed code changes. So you'll need to obtain a GitHub account before making code contribution.

1. **Fork** eKuiper to your private repository. Click the `Fork` button in the top right corner of eKuiper repository.
2. **Clone** the repository locally from your personal fork. `git clone https://github.com/<Github_user>/ekuiper.git`.
3. Add eKuiper repo as additional Git remote so that you can sync between local repo and eKuiper.
  ```shell
  git remote add upstream https://github.com/lf-edge/ekuiper.git
  ```

You can use your favorite IDE or editor to develop. You can find information in editor support for Go tools in [Editors and IDEs for GO](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/IDEsAndTextEditorPlugins).

### Create a branch in your fork

You’ll work on your contribution in a branch in your own (forked) repository. Create a local branch, initialized with the state of the branch you expect your changes to be merged into. The `master` branch is active development branch, so it's recommended to set `master` as base branch.

```shell
$ git fetch upstream
$ git checkout -b <my-branch> upstream/master
```

### Code conventions

- Use `go fmt` to format your code before commit code change. eKuiper Github Action CI pipeline reports error if it's
  not format by `go fmt`.
- Configuration key in config files uses camel case format.

### Debug your code

Take GoLand as an example, developers can debug the code: 

1. Debug the whole program. Make sure all directories mentioned in [Makefile](../Makefile) build_prepare sections are created in your eKuiper root path. Add your breakpoints. Open `cmd/kuiperd/main.go`. In the main function, you'll find a green triangle in the ruler, click it and select debug. Then create your stream/rule that would run through your breakpoint, the debugger will pause there.
2. To debug a small portion of code, we recommend writing a unit test and debug it. You can go to any test file and find the same green triangle to run in debug mode. For example, `pkg/cast/cast_test.go` TestMapConvert_Funcs can run as debug.

### Testing

The eKuiper project leverages Github actions to run unit test & FVT (functional verification test), so please take a
look at the PR status result, and make sure that all of testcases run successfully.

- Write Golang unit testcases to test your code if necessary.
- A set of [FVT testcases](../test/README.md) will be triggered with any PR submission, so please make sure that these
  testcases can be run successfully.

### Licensing

All code contributed to eKuiper will be licensed under Apache License V2. You need to ensure every new files you are adding have the right license header.

### Sign-off commit

The sign-off is to certify the origin of the commit. It is required to commit to this project. If you set
your `user.name` and `user.email` git configs, you can sign your commit automatically with `git commit -s`. Each commit must be signed off.

### Syncing

Periodically while you work, and certainly before submitting a pull request, you should update your branch with the most recent changes to the target branch. We prefer rebase than merge to avoid extraneous merge commits.

```shell
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/master
```

Then you can push to your forked repo. Assume the remove name for your forked is the default `origin`. If you have rebased the git history before the last push, add `-f` to force pushing the changes.

```shell
git push origin -f
```

### Submitting changes

The `master` branch is active development branch, so it's recommended to set `master` as base branch, and also create PR
against `master` branch.

Organize your commits to make a committer’s job easier when reviewing. Committers normally prefer multiple small pull requests, instead of a single large pull request. Within a pull request, a relatively small number of commits that break the problem into logical steps is preferred. For most pull requests, you'll squash your changes down to 1 commit. You can use the following command to re-order, squash, edit, or change description of individual commits.

```shell
git rebase -i upstream/master
```

Make sure all your commits comply to the [commit message guidelines](#commit-message-guidelines).

You'll then push to your branch on your forked repo and then navigate to eKuiper repo to create a pull request. Our GitHub repo provides automatic testing with GitHub action. Please make sure those tests pass. We will review the code after all tests passed.

### Commit Message Guidelines

Each commit message consists of a **header**, a **body** and a **footer**. The header has a special format that includes a **type**, a **scope** and a **subject**:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

The **header** with **type** is mandatory. The **scope** of the header is optional. This repository has no predefined scopes. A custom scope can be used for clarity if desired.

Any line of the commit message cannot be longer 100 characters! This allows the message to be easier to read on GitHub as well as in various git tools.

The footer should contain a [closing reference to an issue](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/) if any.

Example 1:

```
feat: add Fuji release compose files
```

```
fix(script): correct run script to use the right ports

Previously device services used wrong port numbers. This commit fixes the port numbers to use the latest port numbers.

Closes: #123, #245, #992
```

#### Revert

If the commit reverts a previous commit, it should begin with `revert: `, followed by the header of the reverted commit. In the body it should say: `This reverts commit <hash>.`, where the hash is the SHA of the commit being reverted.

#### Type

Must be one of the following:

- **feat**: New feature for the user, not a new feature for build script
- **fix**: Bug fix for the user, not a fix to a build script
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **style**: Formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no production code change
- **refactor**: Refactoring production code, eg. renaming a variable
- **chore**: Updating grunt tasks etc; no production code change
- **perf**: A code change that improves performance
- **test**: Adding missing tests, refactoring tests; no production code change
- **build**: Changes that affect the CI/CD pipeline or build system or external dependencies (example scopes: travis, jenkins, makefile)
- **ci**: Changes provided by DevOps for CI purposes.
- **revert**: Reverts a previous commit.

#### Scope

There are no predefined scopes for this repository. A custom scope can be provided for clarity.

#### Subject

The subject contains a succinct description of the change:

- use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
- don't capitalize the first letter
- no dot (.) at the end

#### Body

Just as in the **subject**, use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes". The body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.

#### Footer

The footer should contain any information about **Breaking Changes** and is also the place to reference GitHub issues that this commit **Closes**.

**Breaking Changes** should start with the word `BREAKING CHANGE:` with a space or two newlines. The rest of the commit message is then used for this.

## Community Promotion
