# LF Edge eKuiper - Lightweight data stream processing engine for IoT edge

LF Edge eKuiper is a lightweight IoT data analytics and stream processing engine running on resource-constraint edge
devices. The major goal for eKuiper is to provide a streaming software framework (similar
to [Apache Flink](https://flink.apache.org)) on the edge side. eKuiper's **rule engine** allows users to provide either
SQL-based or graph-based (similar to Node-RED) rules to create IoT edge analytics applications within a few minutes.

## Features

- Lightweight

  - The core server package is only about 4.5M, the memory footprint is about 10MB.

- Cross-platform

  - CPU Archï¼šX86 AMD 32/64; ARM 32/64; PPC
  - Popular Linux distributions, OpenWrt Linux, MacOS and Docker
  - Industrial PC, Raspberry Pi, industrial gateway, home gateway, MEC edge cloud server

- Data analysis support

  - Supports data ETL
  - Data order, group, aggregation and join with different data sources (the data from databases and files)
  - 60+ functions, including mathematical, string, aggregate and hash, etc.
  - 4 time windows and a count window

- Highly extensible

  It supports extending at `Source`, `Functions` and `Sink` with Golang or Python.

  - Source: allows users to add more data sources for analytics.
  - Sink: allows users to send the analysis result to different customized systems.
  - UDF functions: allow users to add customized functions for data analysis (for example, AI/ML function invocation).

- Management

  - [A free web-based management dashboard](https://hub.docker.com/r/emqx/ekuiper-manager) for visualized management
  - Plugins, streams and rules management through CLI, REST API and config maps (Kubernetes)
  - Can be easily integrated with Kubernetes
    frameworks [KubeEdge](https://github.com/kubeedge/kubeedge), [OpenYurt](https://openyurt.io/), [K3s](https://github.com/rancher/k3s), [Baetyl](https://github.com/baetyl/baetyl)

- Integration with EMQX products

  Seamless integration with [EMQX](https://www.emqx.io/), [Neuron](https://neugates.io/) and [NanoMQ](https://nanomq.io/), and provided an end-to-end solution from IIoT, IoV
