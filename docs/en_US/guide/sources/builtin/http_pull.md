# HTTP pull source

eKuiper provides built-in support for pulling HTTP source stream, which can pull the message from HTTP server broker and feed into the eKuiper processing pipeline.  The configuration file of HTTP pull source is at `etc/sources/httppull.yaml`. Below is the file format.

```yaml
#Global httppull configurations
default:
  # url of the request server address
  url: http://localhost
  # post, get, put, delete
  method: post
  # The interval between the requests, time unit is ms
  interval: 10000
  # The timeout for http request, time unit is ms
  timeout: 5000
  # If it's set to true, then will compare with last result; If response of two requests are the same, then will skip sending out the result.
  # The possible setting could be: true/false
  incremental: false
  # The body of request, such as '{"data": "data", "method": 1}'
  body: '{}'
  # Body type, none|text|json|html|xml|javascript|form
  bodyType: json
  # HTTP headers required for the request
  insecureSkipVerify: true
  headers:
    Accept: application/json
  # how to check the response status, by status code or by body
  responseType: code
  #  # Get token
#  oAuth:
#    # Access token fetch method
#    access:
#      # Url to fetch access token, always use POST method
#      url: https://127.0.0.1/api/token
#      # Body of the request
#      body: '{"username": "admin","password": "123456"}'
#      # Expire time of the token in string, time unit is second, allow template
#      expire: '3600'
#    # Refresh token fetch method
#    refresh:
#      # Url to refresh the token, always use POST method
#      url: https://127.0.0.1/api/refresh
#      # HTTP headers required for the request, allow template from the access token
#      headers:
#        identityId: '{{.data.identityId}}'
#        token: '{{.data.token}}'
#      # Request body
#      body: ''

#Override the global configurations
application_conf: #Conf_key
  incremental: true
  url: http://localhost:9090/pull
```

## Global HTTP pull configurations

Use can specify the global HTTP pull settings here. The configuration items specified in `default` section will be taken as default settings for all HTTP connections.

### url

The URL where to get the result.

### method

HTTP method, it could be post, get, put & delete.

### interval

The interval between the requests, time unit is ms.

### timeout

The timeout for http request, time unit is ms.

### incremental

If it's set to true, then will compare with last result; If response of two requests are the same, then will skip sending out the result.

### body

The body of request, such as `'{"data": "data", "method": 1}'`

### bodyType

Body type, it could be none|text|json|html|xml|javascript|format.

### certificationPath

The location of certification path. It can be an absolute path, or a relative path. If it is a relative path, then the base path is where you're executing the `kuiperd` command. For example, if you run `bin/kuiperd` from `/var/kuiper`, then the base path is `/var/kuiper`; If you run `./kuiperd` from `/var/kuiper/bin`, then the base path is `/var/kuiper/bin`.  Such as  `d3807d9fa5-certificate.pem`.

### privateKeyPath

The location of private key path. It can be an absolute path, or a relative path.  For more detailed information, please refer to `certificationPath`. Such as `d3807d9fa5-private.pem.key`.

### rootCaPath

The location of root ca path. It can be an absolute path, or a relative path.

### insecureSkipVerify

Control if to skip the certification verification. If it is set to true, then skip certification verification; Otherwise, verify the certification

### headers

The HTTP request headers that you want to send along with the HTTP request.

### responseType

Define how to parse the HTTP response. There are two types defined:

- code: which means to check the response status from the HTTP status code.
- body: which means to check the response status from the response body. The body must be "application/json" content type and contains a "code" field.

### OAuth

Define the authentication flow to follow the OAuth style. Other authentication method like apikey can directly set the key to header only, not need to set this configuration.

OAuth 2.0 is an authorization protocol that gives an API client limited access to user data on a web server. The most common flow for oAuth is authorization code, mostly used for server-side and mobile web applications. With this flow, users sign up into a web application using their account and the authentication code is return to the application. After that, the application can use the authentication code to request an access token and possibly refresh the tokens by refresh token after expiration.

In this configuration, we assume the authentication code has already known, and the user just specify the token fetch process which may require that code or just password as an oAuth variant authentication.

There are two parts to configure: access for access code fetch and refresh for token refresh which is optional.

#### access

- url: The url to fetch access token, will always use POST method.
- body: The request body to fetch access token. Usually, the authorization code is needed here.
- expire: Expire time of the token, time unit is second, allow to use template, so it must be a string.

#### refresh

- url: the url to refresh the token, always use POST method.
- headers: the request header to refresh the token. Usually put the tokens here for authorization.
- body: the request body to refresh the token. May not need when using header to pass the refresh token.

## Dynamic Properties

Dynamic properties are properties that are updated at runtime.
You can use dynamic attributes to specify the HTTP request's URL, body and header.
The syntax is based on [data template](../../sinks/data_template.md) format for dynamic attributes.

The attributes that can be used include:

- PullTime: The timestamp of the current pull time in int64 format.
- LastPullTime: The timestamp of the last pull time in int64 format.

If the target HTTP service supports filtering the start and end times,
these two properties can be used to implement incremental pulls.

- If the target HTTP service passes the start and end times via the url parameter, you can configure the
  URL, e.g. `http://localhost:9090/pull?start={{.LastPullTime}}&end={{.PullTime}}`.
- If the target HTTP service passes the start and end times via the body parameter, you can configure the
  body, e.g. `{"start": {{.LastPullTime}}, "end": {{.PullTime}}`.

## Override the default settings

If you have a specific connection that need to overwrite the default settings, you can create a customized section. In
the previous sample, we create a specific setting named with `application_conf`. Then you can specify the configuration
with option `CONF_KEY` when creating the stream definition (see [stream specs](../../../sqls/streams.md) for more info).

**Sample**

```text
demo (
    ...
  ) WITH (DATASOURCE="test/", FORMAT="JSON", TYPE="httppull", KEY="USERID", CONF_KEY="application_conf");
```

The configuration keys used for these specific settings are the same as in `default` settings, any values specified in specific settings will overwrite the values in `default` section.
