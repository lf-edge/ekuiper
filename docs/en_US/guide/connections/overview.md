# Connection Management

Sources and Sinks are used for interacting with external systems, which involve connecting to external resources. This
chapter primarily explains how eKuiper manages connections.

## Connection Types

Different connection types vary in complexity. For example, MQTT long connections require attention to connection
status, and there may be disconnections during rule execution that necessitate automatic reconnection. On the other
hand, HTTP connections are stateless by default, making their state management simpler. To unify the management of
complex connection resources, including creation, reuse, automatic reconnection, and obtaining connection status,
eKuiper v2 introduced an internal connection pool component and adapted a series of connection types:

- MQTT Connection
- Neuron Connection
- EdgeX Connection
- SQL Connection
- HTTP Connection (including REST sink, HTTP Pull source, and HTTP push source connections)
- WebSocket Connection

Other connection types may be gradually integrated in subsequent versions. Connection types integrated into the
connection pool can be independently created via API and accessed.

In eKuiper, the lifecycle management of various connections is divided into three types:

1. **Connection Attached to Rule**: By default, connections are managed by the Source/Sink implementation itself, with
   their lifecycle controlled by the rule in use. The connection resources will only start connecting when the rule is
   started; when the rule ends, the connection will be closed. In the example below, we create a data stream `memStream`
   of type `memory`. Since this type is not integrated into the connection pool, the connection will only be established
   when a rule using this stream is started.

   ```sql
   create stream memStream () WITH (TYPE="mqtt", DATASOURCE="demo")
   ```

2. **Anonymous Connection Resource Managed by Connection Pool**: Some connection types are adapted to the connection
   pool management interface, with their lifecycle managed by the connection pool. When a rule containing these types of
   connections is started, the rule will obtain an anonymous (actual resource id generated by the rule and not shared)
   resource from the connection pool. In the example below, we create a data stream `mqttStream` of type `mqtt`. The
   connection is anonymous, and since this type is adapted to the connection pool, we can retrieve this connection via
   the connection API. When the rule is deleted, the corresponding connection will also be deleted.

   ```sql
   create stream mqttStream () WITH (TYPE="mqtt", DATASOURCE="demo")
   ```

3. **User-Created Connection Resource**: Users can add, delete, modify, and query resources via
   the [Connection Management API](../../api/restapi/connection.md). Resources created via the API must specify a unique
   id, which can be referenced in rules. **Note**: Only connection resources adapted to the connection pool can be
   managed via the API. Connections created in this way are independent physical connections that run immediately after
   creation and do not depend on rules. They can be shared by multiple rules or multiple sources/sinks.

**Note**: User-created connections are physical connections that will automatically reconnect until the connection is
successful.

### Connection Reuse

User-created connection resources can run independently, and multiple rules can reference this named resource.
Connection reuse is configured through the `connectionSelector` configuration item. Users only need to create the
connection resource once for reuse, improving connection management efficiency and simplifying the configuration
process.

1. **Create Resource**: As shown in the example below, create a connection with id `mqttcon1` via the API. The
   connection parameters required can be configured in `props`. After the connection is successfully created, `mqttcon1`
   can be found in the connection list API.

   ```shell
   POST http://localhost:9081/connections
   {
     "id": "mqttcon1"
     "typ":"mqtt",
     "props": {
       server: "tcp://127.0.0.1:1883"
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Use in Data Source**: When configuring the MQTT source (`$ekuiper/etc/mqtt_source.yaml`), you can reference the
   above connection configuration via `connectionSelector`, for example, both `demo_conf` and `demo2_conf` will
   reference the connection configuration of `mqttcon1`.

```yaml
#Override the global configurations
demo_conf: #Conf_key
  qos: 0
  connectionSelector: mqttcon1
  servers: [tcp://10.211.55.6:1883, tcp://127.0.0.1]

#Override the global configurations
demo2_conf: #Conf_key
  qos: 0
  connentionSelector: mqttcon1
  servers: [tcp://10.211.55.6:1883, tcp://127.0.0.1]
```

Based on `demo_conf` and `demo2_conf`, create two data streams `demo` and `demo2`:

```text
demo (
    ...
  ) WITH (DATASOURCE="test/", FORMAT="JSON", CONF_KEY="demo_conf");

demo2 (
    ...
  ) WITH (DATASOURCE="test2/", FORMAT="JSON", CONF_KEY="demo2_conf");

```

When corresponding rules reference the above data streams, the source parts of the rules will share the connection.
Here, `DATASOURCE` corresponds to the MQTT subscription topic, and the `qos` in the configuration item will be used as
the `Qos` for subscription. In the example configuration above, `demo` subscribes to topic `test/` with Qos 0,
and `demo2` subscribes to topic `test2/` with Qos 0.

::: tip

For MQTT sources, if two streams have the same `DATASOURCE` but different `qos` values, only the rule that starts first
will trigger the subscription.

:::

You can also reuse the defined connection resource in the rule's action via `connentionSelector`.

## Connection Status

Connection status is divided into three types:

1. **Connected**, represented by 1 in metrics.
2. **Connecting**, represented by 0 in metrics.
3. **Disconnected**, represented by 1 in metrics.

Users can retrieve the connection status via the connection API. Additionally, users can view the connection status in
the rule's source/sink metrics, for example, the `source_demo_0_connection_status` metric indicates the connection
status of the `demo` stream. For a complete list of supported connection metrics, please refer to
the [Metrics List](../../operation/usage/monitor_with_prometheus.md#metric-types).
