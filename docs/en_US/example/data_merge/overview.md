# Data Merging

In IoT scenarios, devices such as sensors are often numerous in number. Data between multiple devices is correlated, and applications often need to acquire data from multiple devices in order to perform effective calculations. However, the data generated by each device is often reported independently. The huge amount of data makes data merging a challenge. This chapter introduces some typical data merging scenarios and explains how to use eKuiper for data merging.
