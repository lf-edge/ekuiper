# Cookbook

The cookbook chapter is crafted to guide users on how to leverage eKuiper's features to address particular challenges in IoT scenarios:

- **[Step-by-Step Guide: Navigating eKuiper with the Management Console UI](howto.md)**: This guide provides a concise walkthrough on utilizing eKuiper through its Management Console UI. It offers step-by-step instructions for data preparation, example execution, and result interpretation.
- **[Merge Multiple Devices' Data in a Single Stream](./data_merge/merge_single_stream.md)**: Introduces the concept of data merging in IoT scenarios, where data from multiple sensors needs to be combined for meaningful analysis. A detailed use case is provided, explaining the problem of merging data from sensors with varying data acquisition frequencies.
- **[Data change notification in IoT scenarios](./change_data_capture.md)**: This section will take event notification when data changes in a single data stream as an example to introduce how to implement it through eKuiper.
