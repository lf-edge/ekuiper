# Architecture Design

LF Edge eKuiper is an edge lightweight IoT data analytics and stream processing engine. It is a universal edge computing service or middleware designed for resource constrained edge gateways or devices.

eKuiper is written in Go. The architecture of eKuiper is as below:

As a rule engine, users can submit jobs aka. rule through REST API or CLI. eKuiper rule/SQL parser or graph rule parser will parse, plan and optimize a rule into a flow of processors which leverage streaming runtime and storage if needed.

Processors are loosely coupled and communicate asynchronously with Go channels. Benefit from Go concurrency model, the runtime flow of a rule can

- Communicate asynchronously and non-blocking.
- Easily to engage multiple cores in the modern SMP system.
- Potential to scale in processor level.
- Isolate rules from each other.

These helps eKuiper to achieve low latency and high throughput data processing.

## Computing components

In eKuiper, a computing job is presented as a rule. The rule defines the streaming data sources as the input, the computing logic by SQL and the sinks/actions as the output.

Once a rule is defined, it will run continuously. It will keep fetching data from the source, calculate according to the SQL logic and trigger the actions with the result.

- [sink](./sinks.md)
