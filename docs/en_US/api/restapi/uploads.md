The eKuiper REST api for configuration file uploads allows you to upload configuration files and list all uploaded files.

## Upload a configuration file

The API supports to upload a local file, provide the text content of file or upload a http file link. The upload request will save the file into your `${dataPath}/uploads`. It will override the existed file of the same name. The response is the absolute path of the uploaded file which you can refer in other configurations.

### Upload by a file

The API accepts a multipart file upload requests. Below is an example html file to upload file to `http://127.0.0.1:9081/config/uploads`. In the form data, the file input name must be `uploadFile`.

```html

<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge" />
    <title>Upload File</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <form
      enctype="multipart/form-data"
      action="http://127.0.0.1:9081/config/uploads"
      method="post"
