# Command Line Tool

The eKuiper CLI (command line interface) tool provides streams and rules management.

The eKuiper CLI acts as a client to the eKuiper server. The eKuiper server runs the engine that executes the stream or rule queries. This includes processing stream or rule definitions, managing rule status, and io.
