# LF Edge eKuiper - An edge lightweight IoT data analytics software

eKuiper is an open source stream processing engine for edge computing. The open source project is hosted by [LF Edge](https://lfedge.org/).

It can be run at all kinds of resource constrained edge devices. One goal of eKuiper is to migrate the cloud streaming software frameworks (such as [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org)ï¼Œ[Apache Storm](https://storm.apache.org) and [Apache Flink](https://flink.apache.org)) to edge side.  eKuiper references these cloud streaming frameworks, and also considered special requirement of edge analytics, and introduced **rule engine**, which is based on `Source`, `SQL (business logic)` and `Sink`, rule engine is used for developing streaming applications at edge side.
