eKuiper has implemented the following plugins. At present, some of these plug-ins are examples used to describe the plug-in development process, and some are contributed by community developers. Please read the relevant documents carefully before using the plugins.

Developers of eKuiper plugin can specify metadata files during the development process. These metadata files are mainly used in the following aspects:

- Plugin compilation: For plugins in the directories `plugins/sinks` and `plugins/sources`, if the developer provides
  related metadata files, eKuiper will automatically compile the plugins when the version is released, and then
  automatically upload these plugins to the EMQ plugin download website: www.emqx.io/downloads/kuiper/vx.x.x/plugins,
  where `x.x.x` is the version number.

  **<u>Note: Due to the limitations of Golang plugins, these automatically compiled plugins can run in the container of
  the corresponding version released by eKuiper. However, for the directly downloaded binary installation package, or
  the binary package compiled by the user, these downloaded plugins are not guaranteed to work properly. </u>**

- Visualization: from version 0.9.1, eKuiper will release the management console synchronously with the version, which can be used to manage eKuiper nodes, streams, rules, and plugins. Plugin metadata provided by developers can make it more convenient for users to use plugins. Therefore, it is strongly recommended that plugin developers provide corresponding metadata files when submitting plugins. The metadata file is in JSON format. The file name is consistent with that of the plugin and is placed in the root directory of the compressed package together with the plugin.

## Sources

| Name                                              | Description                                                                 | Remarks                                                   |
|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| [zmq](../../../guide/sources/plugin/zmq.md)       | The plugin listens to Zero Mq messages and sends them to the eKuiper stream | Sample of plugin, not available in production environment |
| [random](../../../guide/sources/plugin/random.md) | The plugin generates messages according to the specified pattern            | Sample of plugin, not available in production environment |

### source metadata file format

Most attributes of a source are specified by the user through the corresponding configuration file,
and the user cannot configure it during the creation of the stream.
In the metadata file provided by the plugin developer, only the following parts need to be specified.

#### libs

This part of the content defines which library dependencies are used by the plugin (the format is `github.com/x/y@version`). During the compilation of the plugin, this information is read and the relevant library dependencies are added to the `go.mod` of the project. The content of this configuration item is a string array.

#### about

* trial: indicates whether the plugin is under beta test stage 

* author

  This part contains the author information of the plugin. The plugin developer can provide this information as appropriate. The information of this part will be displayed in the plugin information list of the management console.

  * name
  * email
  * company
  * website

* helpUrl

  The help file address of the plug-in. The console will link to the corresponding help file according to the language support.

  * en_US: English document help address
  * zh_CN: Chinese document help address

* description

  A simple description of the plugin. The console supports multiple languages.

  * en_US: English description
  * zh_CN: Chinese description

#### properties

  that the user can provide the value of the field;
- control: control type, which controls the type of control displayed in the interface; **This field must be provided;**
  - text: text input box
  - text-area: text editing area
  - list: list box
  - radio: radio box

  - en_US
  - zh_CN
- type: field type; **This field must be provided;**

  * string
  * float
  * int
  * list_object: list, element is structure
  * list_string: list, elements is string
- values: If the control type is `list-box` or `radio`, **this field must be provided;**
