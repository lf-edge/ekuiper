# Portable Plugin

As a supplement to the native plugin, portable plugins aims to provide the equal functionality while allow to run in more general environments and created by more languages. Similar to native plugins, portable plugins also support to customize source, sink and function extensions.

The steps to create plugin is similar to the native plugin.

1. Develop the plugin with SDK.
    1. Develop each plugin symbol(source, sink and function) by implementing corresponding interfaces
    2. Develop the main program to serve all the symbols as one plugin
2. Build or package the plugin depending on the programing language.
3. Register the plugin by eKuiper file/REST/CLI.

We aim to provide SDK for all mainstream language. Currently, [go SDK](go_sdk.md) and [python SDK](python_sdk.md) are supported.

## Development

Unlike the native plugin, a portable plugin can bundle multiple *symbols*. Each symbol represents an extension of source, sink or function. The implementation of a symbol is to implement the interface of source, sink or function similar to the native plugin. In portable plugin mode, it is to implement the interface with the selected language.

Then, the user need to create a main program to define and serve all the symbols. The main program will be run when starting the plugin. The development varies for languages, please check [go SDK](go_sdk.md) and [python SDK](python_sdk.md) for the detail.

### Debugging

We provide a portable plugin test server to simulate the eKuiper main program part while the developers can start the plugin side manually to support debug.

You can find the tool in `tools/plugin_test_server`. It only supports to test a single plugin Testing process.

1. Edit the testingPlugin variable to match your plugin meta.
2. Start this server, and wait for handshake.
3. Start or debug your plugin. Make sure the handshake completed.
4. Issue startSymbol/stopSymbol REST API  to debug your plugin symbol. The REST API is like:

   ```shell
   POST http://localhost:33333/symbol/start
   Content-Type: application/json
   
   {
     "symbolName": "pyjson",
     "meta": {
       "ruleId": "rule1",
       "opId": "op1",
       "instanceId": 1
     },
     "pluginType": "source",
     "config": {}
   }
   ```

## Package

After development, we need to package the result into a zip to be installed. Inside the zip file, the file structure must follow this convention with the correct naming:

- {pluginName}.json: the file name must be the same as the plugin name which defines in the plugin main program and the REST/CLI command.
- the executable file for the plugin main program
- sources/sinks/functions directory: hold the json or yaml file for all defined symbols by category

Optionally, we can package the supportive files like `install.sh` and the dependencies.

In the json file, we need to depict the metadata of this plugin. The information must match the definitions in the plugin main program. Below is an example:

```json
{
  "version": "v1.0.0",
  "language": "go",
  "executable": "mirror",
  "sources": [
    "random"
  ],
   "sinks": [
      "file"
   ],
   "functions": [
      "echo"
   ]
}
```

A plugin can contain multiple sources, sinks and functions, define them in the corresponding arrays in the json file. A
plugin must be implemented in a single language, and specify that in the *language* field. Additionally, the
*executable* field is required to specify the plugin main program executable. Please refer
to [mirror.zip](https://github.com/lf-edge/ekuiper/blob/master/internal/plugin/testzips/portables/mirror.zip) as an
example.

If using Python plugin, users can specify a virtual environment for the python script by specifying the below
properties:

- virtualEnvType: the virtual environment type, currently only `conda` is supported.
- env: the virtual environment name to be run.

For detail, please check [run in virtual environment](./python_sdk.md#virtual-environment).

## Management

The portable plugins can be automatically loaded in start up by putting the content(the json, the executable and all
supportive files) inside `plugins/portables/${pluginName}` and the configurations to the corresponding directories
under `etc`.

To manage the portable plugins in runtime, we can use the [REST](../../api/restapi/plugins.md)
or [CLI](../../api/cli/plugins.md) commands.

## Restrictions

Currently, there are two limitations compared to native plugins:

1. Support less context methods. For example, [State](../native/overview.md#state-storage) and Connection API are not supported; dynamic properties are required to be parsed by developers. Whereas, state is planned to be supported in the future.
2. In the function interface, the arguments cannot be transferred with the AST which means the user cannot validate the argument types. The only validation supported may be the argument count. In the sink interface, the collect function parameter data will always be a json encoded `[]byte`, developers need to decode by themselves.
